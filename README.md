# the_sorting_chime

I was a chimesmaster during college (https://chimes.cornell.edu/) and once a semester ~10 of us would pick preferences for the weekly concert schedule. There are 21 concerts a week (7 days * (morning, afternoon, evening)) and each chimesmaster would be assigned 1-3 weekly concerts. What typically happened was we'd have a group dinner before the beginnning of the semester, and the head chimesmaster would take everyone's preferences and fill up the 21 concerts by hand, basically solving a logic puzzle.

My sophopmore year, I thought it'd be fun to write a program that'd take everyone's preferences and spit out a weekly schedule that everyone would be happy with. I ended up with a text-based interactive scheduler, which I dubbed The Sorting Chime (The Sorting Hat). It felt a bit clunky, so I used the tikinter package to integrate the scheduler into a fancy GUI with check boxes and text boxes.

I got to use the scheduler at the start of the fall semester of my junior year. I passed a paper around and everyone indicated which concerts they'd be able to play. I input the preferences, The Sorting Chime thought for a minute or two, and output every possible permutation of schedules - thousands of them. It was definitely a neat moment for me, to see that it had worked. But then to have to pick one of the permutations felt daunting for some reason. I probably should've made the program randomly pick just one or a handful of permutations to output.

Anyhow, we ended up not using The Sorting Chime again after that first time. I think having the head chimesmaster have to sit and solve a not-entirely-easy puzzle during a nice, paid dinner is a tradition too fun to leave in the past.
